  "About_content": "Hi, My name is Ian Mugambi. I am currently based in Nairobi, Kenya, and have had the pleasure of working with companies from around the world, including Singapore and Vietnam. I have a passion for coding and problem-solving, and I love exploring new technologies and tools to build and improve amazing products.\n\nMy dev journey started in high school. I participated in the Computer Science category at the Kenya National Science and Engineering Fair. Honestly, this is still among the best experiences of my life. I put a lot of work into my project and ended  up a national finalist. The event served as a profound catalyst  that fundamentally altered the timeline I exist in. It pushed further my passion for software engineering. And to this day! I still write code </br>\n\nOverall, I am a driven and passionate software engineer with experience and a strong desire to create innovative solutions. I am always willing to learn, collaborate, and go the extra mile to ensure that the products I build are of the highest quality. If you are looking for a talented software engineer to join your team, I would be more than happy to discuss how I can help.",
